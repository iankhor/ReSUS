## 1. App brief for ReSUS
Healthcare can be quite costly and not everyone has the ability to have private health insurance for non critical medical conditions. 
People could rely on Medicare and the public health system but this would mean prolonging their medical condition at the expense of waiting. 
Hence, ReSUS is a platform that provides a competitive marketplace for healthcare with the aim of lowering healthcare costs. Consequently, 
ReSUS also aims to lower the barriers of entry for healthcare - affordable healthcare for everyone.
